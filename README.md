# Rust CHIP-8 Interpreter

Hello!, my name is Alex Crossley. This is my personal take on a Rust ported CHIP-8 Interpreter (will refer to as just interpreter).

All of the resources and documents used to create my version of the interpreter are listed in the [wiki](https://github.com/AlbeyAl/Rust-Chip-8/wiki) of this repository.

There is also a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/s5hmv8s) setup to allow a community discussion about CHIP-8.
